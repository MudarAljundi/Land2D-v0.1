Topdown game with built-in level editor. Custom JS engine with [PIXI](http://www.pixijs.com/) rendering.

[Play game/editor here!](http://www.newgrounds.com/projects/games/915805/preview)

The actual game has been canceled to work on more interesting projects. The last time I'd worked on the level editor wad 6 months ago. It had been sitting on my hard disk since, but I may go back and finish it if I work on a new Javascript game!

Additional help provided by [PIXI JS](http://www.pixijs.com/) for rendering, [Howler JS](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library) for playing sounds, and [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) for saving map data. Licenses included in /libs folder.  

Made  using [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). Firing SFX by [kantouth](https://www.freesound.org/people/kantouth/sounds/104401/). Fonts by [Brian Kent](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217105843/http://www.aenigmafonts.com/).
